# Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript
### HTML
**HTML** is short for "Hypertext markup langauge". it is not a programming langauge but a markup langauge. and mostly used to develop websites.
**HTML** lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, and a lot more. 
then save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.
## Doctypes
we use the word **doctype** everytime we use html and that's the way to tell the browser which version of html we are currently using.
## Comments
we can comment on a code by using "<!-- -->"
## Attributes
we can use **IDs** and **Classes** to identify and assign them to elements
## grouping elements
we use **Div** and **Span** tags to group elements in a  block.
## headers and footers
as we know the HTML page should be organized and tidy. and almost each HTML page consists of a **header** and a **footer**
**headers** are mostly used to contain the site name and the navigation bar
while **footers** contains copyright information with links to privacy policy and terms and conditions.
## Wireframes 
we use **wireframes** as a plan for what we want our website to look similar to.

## Javascript
javascript is a an object oriented dynamic programming language
it is mainly used to write functions and to make the page more dynamic and functional and active.
it changes the static structure of the HTML to make it better and more alive.
## Scripts
computers are different the human beings so you'll have to speak their language in order for them to understand exactly what you want.
a **script** is a series of functions that is used to achieve a certain goal.
## Variables
**Variables** in javascript and most programming languages are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
