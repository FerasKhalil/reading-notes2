# Readings : Forms and JS Events 
## Duckett HTML book
### **Forms**
- can use **forms** to collect data from users like:
	- text input
	- password input
	- text area
	- radio buttons
	- check boxes
	- drop down boxes
- to submit forms we have
	- submit buttons
	- image buttons
	- file upload
- this is how forms work:
	- a user fills in any type of form that is listed above
		and then presses on a submission button to send information to
		to the server.
		then after the values are passed to the server
		the server processes the information and creates a new page 
		to send back to the browser.
- a form has 2 attributes:
	- action
	- method
- inside a form we have the element **'input'**
	input comes with attributes the most important are:
		- type
		- name
- can use the input and give it a type password for passwords
- **textarea** is used to create multi line texts
- radio butons are used to prompt the user to pick only one of the options listed
- check boxes are used when we want the user to be able to choose more than 1 value
- drop down lists allow the user to pick 1 option of the drop down list
- select then attribute multiple allows the user to pick more than 1 option
	from a drop down list
- input then attribute file will allow the user to choose files
- submit button when clicked will go the link that is inside the action attribute in form
- you can also use attribute type with value of image to make an image submit button
- type 'hidden' will make the form hidden but you can see it if you open code
- can put a search bar with the value search in type attribute
