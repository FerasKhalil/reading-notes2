	- you can always add the alt attribute which is a message that will
		be shown if there was a problem with loading the image.

### JPEG vs PNG vs GIF
- **PNG** gives high quality because it's a lossless image format
- **GIF** is also lossless image format
- **JPEG** is short for "Joint photographic experts group"
	-**JPEG** is considered as "lossy"
	-but **JPEG** can support around 16 million colours
	and this is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes(from JPEG vs PNG vs GIF article)
