# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
## LISTS
we have 3 types of **lists** 
- **ordered lists** it is used for when as an example we have a step by step items and has to go in let's say an ascending order. it's a numbered **list**.
- **unordered lists** are **lists** where items order don't matter, these **lists** begin with a bullet point.
- **definition lists** these lists are formatted to have the definiton on the right and the terms on the left.

## CSS
with **css** you can babsically do almost anything you want to a **box**
a **box** is how css thinks of the html elements, 
it can control it's dimensions, create borders, change margin and padding, show and hide content, change colors, change background colors, change text positions, change width and height and types and a lot more

## javascript arrays
**arrays** are special variables that store multiple values.
personally i think **arrays** are a little similar to lists.
arrays are very helpful when you dont know how many items a list will have.
### creating arrays
to create an **array** just like a normal variable you give it a unique name then assign the values to it.

to access a value in an **array** you think of it as an ordered list that starts with 0 instead of 1.

## if statements
the **if statement** checks a condition, if that condition was true all the code that is inside the curly brackets will be executed except if there was a break; in it.
if that condition was false the **if** code that is inside of it will not be executed and instead it will go to the **else statement** code.

## switch statements
you take a variable and switch it. you check the cases if they are true, if they are true the code inside the case will be executed.
if there isn't a break statement all cases will be executed.
**default** is similar to the else statement in the if statement.

## Loops
loops check a condition if it was true a code will be executed untill it reaches a stopping condition which will make it false
- **for loops** consists of 3 parts first is initial value, second one is the teh value that stops the loop when it gets to it, third one is either an increment or a decrement to the initial value.

- **while-do loops** mostly used when we dont know the stopping value.

- **do-while loops** the code will be executed before checking if the condition is true or not. then it keeps looping until a condition is equals to false.
