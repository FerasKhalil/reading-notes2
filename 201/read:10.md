# Read: 10 - JS Debugging
## chapter 10: Error Handling & Debugging

### Execution context
- statements in js live in either
	- global context
	- function contetxt
	- eval context
### Variable scope
- global: which is the variable that can be used anywhere in the script
- function level: variable that is declared in a function and can only be used inside it.

### Error objects
- error objects are objects that run when an error occurs in script

### breakpoints
- breakpoints are used to sto the execution at any point
- can use a conditional breakpoint which is if a condition occurs the break point triggers

### exceptions
- for exceptions we use try and catch
- we use them if we know our code might fail
- a try should either have a catch or finally or both
