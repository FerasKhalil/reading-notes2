## headings
we have multiple **headings** each one is different from the other by its size and its priority.
the bigger one starts with the number and is written like 
**'h1'** tag we go all the way until the last one which is an **'h6'** tag.
## paragraphs
we use **paragraphs** to write whatever we want in the **'p'** tag.

### <br/> 
we use **'br'** tag to add a line break inside a paragraph.

### <strong>
we use **'strong'** element if to indicate that teh content has strong importance.

### <em>
we use the **'em'** element to make a text italic.
### css
**css** is short for 'cascading style sheets'
you can change how the elements are displayed with **css** properties.
you can change on fonts, colors, background colors, padding, margin and a lot more with **css**.
you can use **css** as external or internal, 
but using it as external is always best practice.
using it as internal is supposed to be inside the **'style'** tag.

### scripts
a **script** is a series of instructions for us to talk to the computer for it to make a specific task. each instruction is called a statement, and each statement should end with a semicolon **';'** .

you can store anything you want in a variable such as: strings,numbers,booleans and characters.

we can use all **arithmetic operators** such as additions and subtractions etc..
### decision making
we can make a **flowchart** to help us plan what we want our code to be like, which steps to be performed first.
### comparison operators
we use '==' to make sure if 2 values are equal to each other
'!=' **'doesn't equal to'** to check if 2 values doesn't have the same value.
'===' is called **strict equal to** and it's to check if 2 values have the same value and data type.
