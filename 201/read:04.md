# read:04 Readings : HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
## from duckett html: 
### Links
- **links** allow you to move between pages 
- or to move from one website to another
- or from a part of the webpage to another part 
- **links** also start up your email and adresses new email to anyone you want(from duckett html)
- you create links with the **'a'** tag then put the source to where you want the person who clicked to go to
- relative URLs are used to link between your website pages, they tell the browser where to find your files(from duckett html)
- use the href attribute to tell the browser which page you're linking to.

### Layout
- basically i'm talking about controlling elements to make the webpage look better.
- css gives us the ability to control the positioning of elements.
	-Normal flow
	- Relative positioning
	- Absolute positioning
	- fixed positioning
- can also float elements 
	- to the left
	- to the right
- Fixed width layouts
	- these elements do not allow their sizes to change
- Liquid layouts
	- use percentage to stretch the elements

### Multiple stylesheets
- we can use multiple stylesheets if we have a big code
	and use them however we like such as making one 
	for the colors and one for the fonts etc..

## From dcukett js:

### Javascript
- a script is a set of statements that contain precise instructions.
- variable are what you assign values to so you can use them
- arrays are special variables that has muliple values
- expressions rely on operators to calculate a value(from the js duckett book)

### functions
- are series of statements that perform a sepcific task.
- example on a declared function:
	- function myFunction("parameters"){"code"}
- not all function has to return a value or a result.

## pair programming
- **pair programming** is when to developers share one workstation and work together on a specific task.
- 2 roles of pair programming:
	1. the driver: is the one who's responsible on writing code.
	2. the navigator: is the one guiding the navigator.
### why pair programming?
- learning any new langauge must have 4 steps:
	- speaking
	- writing
	- listening
	- reading
pair programming has all 4, which makes it easier to learn and easier to write code.
- advantages of pair programming:
	while pair programming has a lot of advantages in my opinion these are 
	the most important:
	- greater efficiency.
	- engaged collaboration.
	- social skills.
	- learning from fellow students.
