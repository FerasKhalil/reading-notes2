- teams are more effective when everyone is friends out of work
- psychological safety is very important in teams and groups whether for working or studying etc..
	- pyschological safety is when one feels comfortable in speaking up without the fear 
		of that someone might embarrass, reject or punish them.
		it's just being comofrtable with yourself around others
	- the team would'nt be so great or getting better if one or more
		weren't comfortable enough to speak up their thoughts.
- one way to solve this problem is by giving each one of the team members
	turns during a conversation, teaching them how to listen to others more.
- the best thing to do if you want a team to work is helping them learn to communicate
	with eachother.
- if the team has a leader/manager that person will make a lot of effort to make the team work
	that person must know the difference between a leader and a boss.
	- a boss is a person who gives orders.
	- a leader is the person who leads the team and knows what is better for them and actually
		works with them, not just give orders to them.
- in my opinion the leader has the most pressure because if he fails at his role, the whole team is
	is at risk of failing theirs too. a leader must be the role model for his team and the person
		they look up to and feel comfortable in sharing their thoughts with.
		the leader must be a good listener that listens to everybody's ideas no matter how silly it might look at first.
