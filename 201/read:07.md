## Domain modeling
- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem

- The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.

- to generate a random number we use math.random()
	and give it max and min values to generate from
## Tables
**Tables** represent information in a grid format
	of duckett html. link: file:///C:/Users/LTUC/Desktop/duckett_html.pdf
- to create a table we use the **'table'** element
	- then we give  it a table row **'tr'**
	- after that we give it a table data **'td'**
- tables can also have a head **'thead'**
- a body **'tbody'**
- and a footer **'tfoot'**

## objects

- the keyword 'new' and the constructor creates a blank object
	then you add properties and methods

- the constructor is a method used to create and initialize objects in classes
- the word **'this'** always refers to only 1 object 
- can use a method inside an object by defining it in it.
- in arrays and objects the name is the key the you assign a value to it
- arrays are special objects
- objects can have an array as one of their value
- just like other variables we can have global objects and local objects
- can use math object to create random numbers
