# HTML and CSS
let me start off with explaining what is **HTML** and **CSS**
## HTML 
let me start with saying that **HTML** is not a programming language, but it's a markup language.
**HTMl** is a shortcut for "Hypertext Markup Language"
**HTML** is a markup language and not considered as a programming language, it's mainly used for developing websites
**HTML** lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, and a lot more. 
then save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.
**HTML** uses tags. **tags** are characters that sit inside angled brackets, and often referred to as elements.
**HTML** decsribes the structure of pages.
**Attributes** provide additional information about the content of an element. they appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of 2 parts which are
1.a name 2.a value and both of them are seperated by an equal sign
each html page contains of a head and a body
a **head** is mostly used for the title
a **body** consists of 3 things which are 
a header, main and a footer

## CSS
first of all **CSS** is not considered as a programming langauge too.
**CSS** is a shortcut for "Cascading Style Sheets"
it's basically what brings life to the html page
it's used for designing the webpage, and changing the appearance and the layout of it, and make it more colorful and alive
you can change colors, change places, change text type and colors and a lot more.
