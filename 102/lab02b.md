#### we all might have heard about growth and fixed mindsets but what are they really? and how can it fix your life? 

##### lets talk about growth mindset because it's the important one 

growth mindset is what's going to make you a productive person, positive person, and will make you look at things from different perspectives. 
 how can you have a growth mindset? i'll talk a little about it and you can search for the rest. 
 our minds are a wonder arent they.. they are fascinating and they are what differentiate us from animals.
 but if we're not paying enough attention we might make our minds work against us, thinking that we are smart and have the talent to do a lot of things when in reality we're fooling ourselves. we might have all of these but with lack of insipration we do nothing, and that doesn't make us as smart as we think we are.
