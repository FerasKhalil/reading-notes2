# what did this exercise teach me?
it taught me to create files in my vs code
and it taught me to clone my repo to my local computer
and to make a content table that makes it easier for me to get back to my files
also it taught me the importance of arranging my files for me and for others who are willing to see it
or for people that i'll be working with in the future
