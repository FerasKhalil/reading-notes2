TEXT EDITORS

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser,
that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a website.


Choosing a text editor is such an important thing to do, you probably think that picking a favorite text editor isn't necessary, but it kind of is a big deal. 
It's important because eventhough all text editors are pretty similar, but not all of them provide the same amount of comfort and satisfaction for each person.
there's really no such thing as "one best editor", the best editor you can find is the one you enjoy using the most.

examples on famous text editors: Notepad++, Sublime, TextWrangler, BB edit, Visual studio code, Atom and Brackets.

COMMAND LINE (TERMINAL) & BASIC NAVIGATION

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given
to you similarly as text. 

#pwd command (print working directory) this command tells you what your current or present working directory is

#ls command (list) to show files (lists directories and files)

#ls - la List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

#mkdir "name" for making a directory

#a folder is also a directory they contain files

#cd command(Change Directories) for moving to another directory

#cd .. is for going back to the previous directory

#cd ../.. is for going back 2 directories

#touch index.html creates a file called index.html

#A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.
There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative
1.Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( '/' )
2.Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system.

ABOUT FILES

#with linux everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file,
your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file(one that the system writes to only).

#In other systems such as Windows the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is.
Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
as an example i might a have an image file and change its name to .txt, in linux it will still be treated as an image.
there's a command for showing the type of files which is #file [path]

#you have to keep in mind that unlike other systems such as windows, linux actually is case sensetive.

#you can also use spaces when naming a file.
