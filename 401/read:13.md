# Read: Class 13 Linear Regressions
- you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression,
	 classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- Y = boston housing price(also called “target” data in Python)

	and

	X = all the other features (or independent variables)

- lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2)

- lm.<tab> makes you explore the functions inside im

- to draw use .scatter()
