## The code I’m still ashamed of
Bill Sourour talks about a code he wrote when he was just a small developer and was happy of the money he was making.
He basically wrote a code for teenage girls that is a quiz that asks multiple questions.
This quiz prescribes a speicifc drug based on the answers, little did he know most of the results were describing the same drug.
He didn't know much about the drug and its side effects, he only did his job with matching the requirements of the client.
After a while one of his colleagues contacted him telling him that this drug was reported on the news saying that it made a girl commit suicide.
The conclusion is to always know who you are building the website for and try to make sure that everything is legal and ethical. Ask a lot of questions and don't think its okay long as you're getting paid.

## Will democracy survive big data and AI?

We are all seeing a huge and scary evolve of technology such as driving cars, smart homes and who knows what in the future.

Technology is getting scary, It was built to help us in the first place, but as it is evolving it's taking control of us.

###  Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?
- I do agree with all of what I read, I wouldn't write something that I don't agree with.
- What actually stuck to me is that I watched an episode of black mirror (I advise whoever is reading this to watch it) that talks about how technlogoy will take over our world and how all of us will have a score and points that determine each one of us, and can affect in getting a job, travelling, buying houses etc.. .
Although this is a sacry idea but I'm sure it still needs too much time that most of us would be dead until that happens.
