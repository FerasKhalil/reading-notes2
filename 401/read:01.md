it's gonna be a hard course, but is also similar to the previous ones that i passed already. i'll be solving solutions that i heard about hours in the lecture time and more.

### Beginners Guide to Big O
- **O(N)** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

- **O(NÂ²)** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.    
    - basically nested loops

- **O(2^N)** denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- **Logarithms** 
- Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets 
    - it works by comparing a targeted value with a median value in the list, if the value equals the median in the list it will return success. if the targeted value was bigger than the median it will compare the targeted value with the bigger half after the median in the list. 
    and if the targeted value was less than the median it will compare it to the low half of the list.
