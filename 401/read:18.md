## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking
- One of the earlies encryption tools is the ceasar cipher
- The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.
- A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
- G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F


- Three key aspects of data encryption:
	1. Encryption: Scrambling the data according to a secret key.
	2. Decryption: Recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
	3. Code Cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

## Ceasar Cipher
- It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario.
