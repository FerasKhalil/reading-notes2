## Django Settings Best Practices
- To manage Django settings issues there are differnet things to consider:
	1. Different environments.
	2. Sensitive data.
	3. Sharing settings between team members: you need a generalapproach to eliminate party app or some API integration

- The settings file is a small but very important part of any django  project




## SSH Tutorial
- It's short for secure shell.
- If youâ€™re using Linux or Mac, then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client 
	to open SSH connections. The most popular SSH client is PuTTY.


- Three different encryptions: 
	1. Symmetrical encryption
	2. Asymmetrical encryption
	3. Hashing.

- Symmetric Encryption
	- Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host.
- Asymmetric Encryption 
	- asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. 

- Hashing
	- One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections.
	- One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted.
