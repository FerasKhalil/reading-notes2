### nosql vs sql 
#### five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
- SQL:
1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
2. SQL databases are table based databases
3. SQL databases have predefined schema
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable
5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data

- NoSQL:
1. NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2. databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
3. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
5. NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database
- the highly structured data

2. Give a real world example.
- a  human resources manager may perform a query on an employee database that selects all 
 employees in a specific department that were hired between 11 and 12 months ago. The results might be used to provide the department head with current candidates for an annual review

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- No complex queries, stored procedures, or views

4. Give a real world example.
- ad targeting platforms utilizing NoSQL include those from AOL, Mediamind and PayPal

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- document based databases

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
- NoSQL databases

1. What does SQL stand for?
- structured query language

2. What is a relational database?
- it's a database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- data structure

4. What is a ‘schema’?

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
- collections and documents

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- mongoDB is more flexible because it's easier to set-up adn has advanced query features
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
-  consistency in performance and scalability
