first of all i'd like to say that i'm not sure if this is the right way of using this file but i'd like to believe that it is.

- i want to know if i had the right answers when asked:
    1. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
    2. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

- if i was wrong i'd like to know the right answers if possible
