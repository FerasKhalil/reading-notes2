# Read: Class 07 REST

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
- it's basically talking about a person who was in the wrong group 
	and then decided to change it to others who understand more
	she met new people that will motivate her and make her more competitive
	in a good way. and it was where she belonged
- this whole story shows me that it's important to know who my partner is
	to pick someone who is eager to learn and will motivate me when i need it.
	it also shows that you can learn a lot from your partner or anyone really.

### How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
	- he is the guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… 
	and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification
 	for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
	- from (https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
	- Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being
	 able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to 
	get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
	- from (https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
	- HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL 
	you typed in and back comes a web page.
	- from (https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

4. What does a GET do?
	- it allows browsers to get stuff

5. What does a POST do?
	- it allows system to add something to another system

6. What does PUT do?
	- The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI

7. What does PATCH do?
	- The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request- URI
	- from(https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+Patch+do+in+REST&sxsrf=ALeKk02hlMdU_80VKKO4mTOGXa9w84wffQ%3A1621792078845&ei=TpWqYKqYM7yM9u8PiNWi4AM&oq=what+does+Patch+do+in+REST&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyAggAOgcIABBHELADOgYIABAHEB46CAgAEAgQBxAeUOTzAVjy-wFg0f0BaAFwAngAgAGkAYgBzAeSAQMwLjeYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiq94imruDwAhU8hv0HHYiqCDwQ4dUDCA4&uact=5)
